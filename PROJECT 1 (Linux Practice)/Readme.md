## `sudo` Command
This command is used to update the package lists for available software packages from the configured repositories. I used *sudo apt upgrade*.

## `pwd` command
pwd means Print Working Directory. it prints the path of the working directory, starting with the root.
pwd command does not have any argument or options, but it can accept flags for specific behavior like -L and -P.
I used the following; 
- *pwd -L* :This was used to obtain the symbolic path of my directory containing a symbolic link.
- *pwd -P* :This was used to display the actual path, ignoring symbolic links.
